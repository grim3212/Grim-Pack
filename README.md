#[Grim Pack](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/grim-pack)

This is the combined mods previously known as Grims Mods.

These are seperated into 7 parts.

Core, Cuisine, Decor, Industry, Tools, Util, and World

Core is what all of the sub parts rely on.
Cuisine is foody stuff.
Decor is for decorating and making everything look nice.
Industry is more technical blocks mostly.
Tools is tools and weapons.
Util is utilities like FusRoDah.
World is for world gen and entities.

## Versioning
For the most part I am using the versioning conventions found at [http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/](http://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).
But instead of resetting all lesser values to 0 I will only do that when updating to a new version. Or, using that page, when incrementing MAJORMOD.
